# 🎮 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI (with Alpha–Beta Pruning)
*CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship*

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is an **AI-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** developed as part of the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The player competes against an AI opponent that uses the **Minimax algorithm** enhanced with **Alpha–Beta Pruning** —  
making the AI both **unbeatable** and **efficient**.

The game is played in the console, where the user plays as **X** and the AI plays as **O**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the working of **game theory** and **search algorithms**.  
- Implement the **Minimax algorithm** for strategic decision-making.  
- Optimize the algorithm using **Alpha–Beta pruning** to reduce unnecessary computations.  
- Develop a fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that demonstrates AI logic.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Unbeatable AI using Minimax with Alpha–Beta Pruning.  
- Detects wins, draws, and invalid inputs.  
- Simple console interface.  
- Fast and efficient decision-making due to pruning optimization.  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Algorithm:** Minimax + Alpha–Beta Pruning  
- **Libraries:** `math` (for infinity constants)
