# 🤖 Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses  
*CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship*

---

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a **rule-based chatbot** built using Python for the **CodSoft Artificial Intelligence Internship**.  
The chatbot responds to user queries based on predefined rules using simple conditional logic (*if–else statements*).  
It demonstrates the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **conversation flow design**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how rule-based systems work.  
- Implement basic text processing and pattern matching.  
- Learn how to build an interactive chatbot.  
- Optionally, enhance the chatbot with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Responds to greetings and farewells.  
- Displays the current time dynamically.  
- Handles unknown inputs gracefully.  
- Two versions:
  - 🖥️ **Console Version (`chatbot.py`)**
  - 🪟 **GUI Version (`chatbot_gui.py`)** using Tkinter  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Datetime module** (for time responses)
- **Tkinter** (for GUI interface)
